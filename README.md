# EDA-Potential-Insurance-Customers

## Initial plan for Data Exploration:
1. Removing the unnecessary features first.
2. Replacing the null values and Data cleaning.
3. Data wrangling: mean, std, max and, also correlation
4. Univariate analysis: to understand single feature precisely.
5. Bi-variate and Multi-variate analysis: for drawing out insights, inferences.
